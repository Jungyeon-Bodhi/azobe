## Plan International - Baseline of Country Strategy (FY2024 â€“ FY2028)

This code is working based on two Python files (azobe_data_analysis.py and azobe_stats.py)

The 24-PI-NG-1 Data Preprocessing file handles data preprocessing tasks, including data anonymisation, and removing duplicates and missing values.

The 24-PI-NG-1 Data Analysis file performs data analysis for this project. It creates tables and visualisations for each indicator and social demographic.

Before running the scripts, please place the four survey datasets in the "\data\raw data" folder and download the Jupyter Notebook.
