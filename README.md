# Plan International - Baseline of Country Strategy (FY2024 â€“ FY2028)

This code is working based on two Python files (azobe_data_analysis.py and azobe_stats.py)

The '24-PI-NG-1 Data Preprocessing' file handles data preprocessing tasks, including data anonymisation, and removing duplicates and missing values.

The '24-PI-NG-1 Data Analysis' file performs data analysis for this project. It creates tables and visualisations for each indicator and social demographic.

Before running the data preprocessing script, please place the four raw survey datasets in the "\data\raw data" folder.
Before running the data analysis script, please place the four cleaned survey datasets in the "\data\clean data" folder.

Please download Anaconda Navigator for Jupyter Notebook and the following Python libraries before running this code: (https://docs.anaconda.com/navigator/)
-> pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, PIL, openyxl, scipy.stats, statsmodels
